*A note on this document:  
Libraccess is a project to build a platform to make open access resources widely available.  
In relation to this ojective, Libraccess will adopt an open and transparent governance.

# Report on #Force2015 Conference, Oxford, 11-13 January 2015.
Author of this report: Clement Levallois
Date of the report: 14 Jan 2015.
Participant: Clement Levallois  
Objective of the participation: connecting with the #openaccess community and stakeholders of scholarly communication to make Libraccess known and gather support for it.  

## 1. Summary of results
- Many personal connections made with active promoters of the open access movement.  
- Around 50 paper copies of the [Libraccess proposal](https://github.com/Libraccess/docs/wiki/Libraccess-original-proposal) distributed.  
- from 5 to 31 ["interested observers"](https://github.com/Libraccess/docs/wiki/list-of-'interested-observers'-of-the-Libraccess-initiative).  
- 1 organization joined as an interested observer: [Ubiquity Press](http://www.ubiquitypress.com/).  
- Large number of interactions on the twitter account ([@Libraccess](https://twitter.com/Libraccess)), up to 92 followers.  


## 2. Things learned  

### a) Libraccess will connect with similar initiatives  
Many participants to the conference pointed to initiatives similar to Libraccess. [CORE](http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/) is the initiative tha was mentioned most often (maybe because we were in Oxford and CORE is a British initiative).  
The opinion was generally that these existing initiatives (list [here](https://github.com/Libraccess/docs/wiki/list-of-similar-and-potentially-allied-projects)) do not make Libraccess unnecessary, rather, Libraccess could be associated with them. The consensus was also that it is necessary to understand why these initiatives did not take off as much as we could wish. Consulting with these initiatives is then an essential step.  

### b) Open access journals can be harvested! Not just repositories  
The [Libraccess proposal](https://github.com/Libraccess/docs/wiki/Libraccess-original-proposal) is focusing much on harvesting repos. But publishers, as long as they are OA and provide APIs, can be harvested too. That is why it makes sense for [Ubiquity Press](http://www.ubiquitypress.com/) to join as an interested observer. Plos is an obvious other candidate (Plos people, if you read this, send an email!).  

### c) Structure of the community at #Force2015
These are just personal and subjective perceptions:  
- As expected the conference is a mix of public and private stakeholders in the e-Research and scholarly communication community. Not all concerned with open access. Very much US and European centric.  
- The most vocal defense of the values and agenda of open access was the one of team of Pr. [Peter Murray-Rust](http://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/pm286). He heads a project called [Content Mine](http://contentmine.org/) which mines facts from publications. They developed a number of tools which would be useful to mine #OA repositories.  
- The community is very much centered around publishing and gold open access: open access journals, how to host / mine / represent data in these journals... I was surprised to see the #OA institutional repositories not represented and barely discussed.  
- Many participants were also researchers presenting posters on useful tools to mine scientific publications.  

### d) There might be a possibility of collaboration with commercial entities which position themselves in alignment with the open access movement  
Remarks by people from [Figshare](http://figshare.com/), and possibly [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) ?, made me think that they could be open to discussions on the harvesting of their content by a platform such as Libraccess. It might then be a good thing to dialogue with them on this issue.  

### e) Not everyone is at #Force2015
I heard that the [OpenCon Conference](http://www.righttoresearch.org/) organized by the Right To Research Coalition is another venue possibly more focused on open access. It is surely worth attending the next edition of this conference.  


## 3. Next steps  
In the following days and weeks I will get back in touch with the contacts formed at the conference who did not join yet as interested observers. There is often some confusion to clear, as many overestimate the level of commitment asked from them at the moment. Then, we will proceed with the roadmap as presented [here](https://github.com/Libraccess/docs/wiki/road-map).
